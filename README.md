iOS 11+ ARKit application with

- fullscreen WKWebView to render the webpage
- WebAR compatibility with WebARonARKit/Core
- ARKit integration, including access to raw feature points / point cloud
- Voice recognition using Siri
- Text-to-speech using AVSpeechSynthesizer (FIXME: a bit flaky/crash-y at the moment)

(Also, Hockey files are integrated, but untested.)
