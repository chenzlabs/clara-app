# clara-app

iOS 11+ ARKit application with

- fullscreen WKWebView to render the webpage
- WebAR compatibility with WebARonARKit/Core
- ARKit integration, including access to raw feature points / point cloud
- Voice recognition using Siri
- Text-to-speech using AVSpeechSynthesizer

FIXME: a tiny bit flaky/crash-y at the moment, 
sometimes voice and text-to-speech don't get along well at the moment
